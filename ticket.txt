Hi, we have an existing Nimbus instance used to stage files from Banksia for the MWA telescope ‘ASVO’ data portal.
Its IP is 192.168.0.112 (internal), 146.118.65.254 (external), and it accesses the Scout API servers vss1-6 on
146.118.74.144-149 on port 8080 to stage files, and connects to the Pawsey Kafka server franz.pawsey.org.au on
port 9093 to subscribe to messages about files that have been staged.

I’m in the middle of setting up a new dev server, on another Nimbus instance, IP 192.168.0.121 (internal),
146.118.69.232 (external). Could you please make sure that the new instance has the same access to
146.118.74.144-149 port 8080 and franz.pawsey.org.au (146.118.50.18) as the existing instance?
