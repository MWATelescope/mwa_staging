Hi, we have an existing Nimbus instance used to stage files from Banksia for the MWA telescope ‘ASVO’ data portal.
Its IP is 192.168.0.112 (internal), 146.118.65.254 (external), and it accesses the Scout API servers vss1-6 on
146.118.74.144-149 on port 8080 to stage files, and connects to the Pawsey Kafka server franz.pawsey.org.au on
port 9093 to subscribe to messages about files that have been staged.

I’m setting up a new dev server, on another Nimbus instance, IP 146.118.69.232 (external).

Currently, the new server can't reach the Scout API servers, or establish a connection
to the Kafka server, presumably because of your firewall (looks fine from the Nimbus end).

Could you please make sure that the new instance on 146.118.69.232 has the same access to/from:

    -the Scount API servers on 146.118.74.144-149 port 8080
    -Kafka (port 9093) on franz.pawsey.org.au (146.118.50.18)

as the existing instance?

Thanks,

Andrew
